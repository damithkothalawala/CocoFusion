# Financial Support and Loan Schemes for Coconut Development in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka offers several financial assistance programs to support coconut cultivation and coconut-based industries. Key national schemes – from government bodies, development banks, and commercial banks (e.g. Bank of Ceylon) – are outlined below for easy comparison. Each scheme includes the provider, purpose, eligibility, loan terms, and application process.

## Kapruka Ayojana Loan Scheme (Coconut Cultivation Board + Partner Banks)

- **Provider:** Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) in partnership with banks such as People’s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, DFCC, SMIB, Seylan, Regional Development Bank, etc. ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=)) ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%98Kapruka%20Ayojana%E2%80%99%20loan%20scheme,products%20in%20the%20world%20market))

- **Description:** A concessionary credit scheme to finance **coconut cultivation and farm development**. Loans are provided for new planting, replanting, intercropping in coconut lands, soil conservation, farm machinery, livestock integration (e.g. dairy cattle under coconut), and other improvements – aiming to develop coconut estates as integrated farms for higher productivity ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=%E2%80%98Kapruka%20Ayojana%E2%80%99%20credit%20scheme%20is,and%20equipment%20to%20further%20mechanization)) ([
        Kapruka Loan | Banks in Sri Lanka | Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka
    ](https://www.seylan.lk/agriculture-loan/kapruka-loan#:~:text=Kapruka%20loan%20has%20been%20designed,to%20encourage%20domestic%20coconut%20production)). CCB also offers technical advisory support to borrowers under this scheme ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=)).

- **Eligibility:** **Coconut land owners or long-term leaseholders** are eligible. The land should be between ½ acre and 50 acres ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,Minimum%20equity%20contribution%20of%2020)). Lessees must have a lease at least 2 years beyond the loan term ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,Minimum%20equity%20contribution%20of%2020)). Borrowers need to contribute a minimum of 15–20% equity of the project cost ([SME – Kapruka - Regional Development Bank](https://www.rdb.lk/loans-and-advance/sme-kapruka/#:~:text=Be%20a%20citizen%20of%20Sri,Have%20the%20effective%20repayment%20capacity)) ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=than%202%20years%20in%20excess,Minimum%20equity%20contribution%20of%2020)). They must not be loan defaulters and require a recommendation from the Coconut Cultivation Board confirming the viability of the proposed coconut development project ([SME – Kapruka - Regional Development Bank](https://www.rdb.lk/loans-and-advance/sme-kapruka/#:~:text=Be%20a%20citizen%20of%20Sri,Have%20the%20effective%20repayment%20capacity)).

- **Loan Amount & Interest:** **Up to LKR 3–5 million per project is typical**, offered at a subsidized interest rate around **8% per annum** ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,5%20Mn)). (The exact maximum can vary by bank – for instance, DFCC Bank offers up to Rs. 5 million ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,5%20Mn)), Seylan Bank up to Rs. 3 million ([
        Kapruka Loan | Banks in Sri Lanka | Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka
    ](https://www.seylan.lk/agriculture-loan/kapruka-loan#:~:text=Maximum%20Loan%20Quantum)), and some state banks even up to Rs. 10 million under this scheme ([State Mortgage & Investment Bank](https://www.smib.lk/en/sme/kapruka-ayojana-loans#:~:text=,8.00%25%20p.a)).) The interest rate is well below normal market rates, fixed in the single digits (e.g. 8% p.a. ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,12%20months%20grace)) or 9% p.a. in some cases ([
        Kapruka Loan | Banks in Sri Lanka | Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka
    ](https://www.seylan.lk/agriculture-loan/kapruka-loan#:~:text=,grace%20period%20of%2001%20year))) as it is partly subsidized by the government.

- **Repayment Period:** Typically **5 years** total tenure, which **includes a grace period** on principal repayment of about **12–18 months** at the start ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=)) ([State Mortgage & Investment Bank](https://www.smib.lk/en/sme/kapruka-ayojana-loans#:~:text=,8.00%25%20p.a)). This allows coconut growers time for trees to start yielding. Borrowers start paying back after the initial grace (interest may be payable during grace as applicable) and can repay in installments over the remaining term.

- **How to Apply:** Applications are made through participating banks. A prospective borrower should contact a bank offering the Kapruka Ayojana loan (for example, People’s Bank or Bank of Ceylon) and submit a project plan for coconut cultivation/development. The **Coconut Cultivation Board must evaluate and approve the project**, so the bank will forward the plan to CCB for recommendation ([SME – Kapruka - Regional Development Bank](https://www.rdb.lk/loans-and-advance/sme-kapruka/#:~:text=Be%20a%20citizen%20of%20Sri,Have%20the%20effective%20repayment%20capacity)). Once CCB approval is obtained, the bank processes the loan with its normal credit requirements. Borrowers will need to provide **acceptable security** – usually a mortgage of property or movable assets and/or guarantors as required by the bank ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=Securities)). Eligible farmers can contact local bank branches or CCB regional officers to initiate an application. (All loans are subject to the bank’s terms and CCB’s final approval of the project ([‘Kapruka Ayojana’ Credit Scheme (KACS) - DFCC Bank PLC](https://www.dfcc.lk/products/kapruka-ayojana-credit-scheme-kacs/#:~:text=,by%20the%20Coconut%20Cultivation%20Board)).)

## Kapruka Nipayum Diriya Industrial Loan Scheme (Coconut Dev. Authority + People’s Bank)

- **Provider:** Coconut Development Authority (CDA) in collaboration with People’s Bank. (Launched under the Ministry of Plantation Industries in 2012 via an MoU with People’s Bank ([](https://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/1704951121068676.pdf#:~:text=,Bank%20in%20a%20Memorandum%20of)).)

- **Description:** A **concessionary loan program for coconut-based industries**, intended to **boost coconut product manufacturing and processing businesses** ([Export of coconut related products increases - Sunday Observer](http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/03/fin04.asp#:~:text=Observer%20archives,the%20industries%20related%20to%20coconut)). This scheme provides low-interest financing to encourage entrepreneurs to start or expand industries that add value to coconuts (for example, coconut oil mills, desiccated coconut processing, fiber and shell product manufacturing, etc.). It was introduced as “Kapruka Nipayum Diriya” (meaning “coconut industry strength”) to revitalize the coconut industry by supporting industrialists in the sector ([Export of coconut related products increases - Sunday Observer](http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/03/fin04.asp#:~:text=Observer%20archives,the%20industries%20related%20to%20coconut)).

- **Eligibility:** **Coconut industry entrepreneurs** – typically small and medium-scale industrialists engaged in processing or manufacturing coconut-based products. The business should be registered with the Coconut Development Authority to qualify. Applicants must meet People’s Bank’s credit criteria and obtain a recommendation from the CDA. In practice, the CDA coordinates to identify eligible industrialists (e.g. those who have registered coconut product factories) and recommends them for the loan ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). This scheme does *not* cover cultivation; it is for value addition enterprises.

- **Loan Amount & Interest:** Provides **mid-sized loans (approximately up to LKR 2 million)** to each eligible coconut industry project, on **highly concessionary interest terms**. The interest rate to the borrower is very low – around **6% per annum** effectively – because the Coconut Development Authority subsidizes a portion of the interest cost ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=Authority%20are%20eligible%20for%20the,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). (People’s Bank initially extends the loan at its standard commercial rate, but the CDA reimburses a significant share of the interest to make it affordable ([](https://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/1704951121068676.pdf#:~:text=People%27s%20Bank%20%27Kapruka%20Nipayum%20Diriya%27,By%20paying%20the%20installments%20to)).) For working capital loans, the rate may be slightly higher (around 8%) but still subsidized ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=Authority%20are%20eligible%20for%20the,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). This cheap credit is intended to reduce the financial burden on coconut product manufacturers.

- **Repayment Period:** **Up to 5 years** repayment, typically in **60 monthly installments** ([](https://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/1704951121068676.pdf#:~:text=People%27s%20Bank%20%27Kapruka%20Nipayum%20Diriya%27,By%20paying%20the%20installments%20to)). (This corresponds to the term mentioned for People’s Bank’s implementation.) In some cases, longer terms were considered for certain investments, but generally the loan is amortized over about five years. Borrowers receive an interest rebate during the initial years: for example, the CDA fully covered the interest in the first year and 50% in the next few years in earlier implementations ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=capital%2C%20the%20interest%20rate%20is,repayment%20period%20is%20three%20years)). This effectively reduces the cost in the early stages of the project. The exact structure of interest subsidy/rebate may be subject to the agreement at loan signing.

- **How to Apply:** Interested coconut product manufacturers can apply through **People’s Bank** under this scheme. Applications may be funneled through the CDA: typically, an entrepreneur should register with the Coconut Development Authority and submit their project proposal to the CDA or People’s Bank. The **CDA will verify the project’s viability and issue a recommendation** to the bank ([](https://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/1704951121068676.pdf#:~:text=,Bank%20in%20a%20Memorandum%20of)). With that, the applicant proceeds to People’s Bank which will handle the loan approval and disbursement. The loan is disbursed by People’s Bank, while the **CDA directly handles the interest subsidy**, reimbursing the agreed portion of interest to the borrower or the bank as per the scheme’s mechanism ([](https://parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/1704951121068676.pdf#:~:text=People%27s%20Bank%20%27Kapruka%20Nipayum%20Diriya%27,By%20paying%20the%20installments%20to)). For more information, entrepreneurs can contact the Coconut Development Authority or People’s Bank enterprise credit division.

## Kapruka Jaya Isura Loan Scheme (Coconut Dev. Authority + Regional Dev. Bank)

- **Provider:** Coconut Development Authority (CDA) in collaboration with Regional Development Bank (RDB – a state-owned development bank). This scheme was launched alongside Nipayum Diriya, via an agreement with RDB in 2017, targeting regions across Sri Lanka ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%98Kapruka%20Ayojana%E2%80%99%20loan%20scheme,products%20in%20the%20world%20market)).

- **Description:** A **nationwide concessionary loan program for coconut-based businesses**, similar in purpose to Nipayum Diriya, but implemented by RDB. It focuses on **financing coconut product industries (not cultivation)** – for example, producers of coconut oil, fiber, charcoal, coconut milk, and other value-added products ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). The goal is to expand processing capacity and modernize coconut-related enterprises, thereby increasing the supply of coconut products for both domestic and export markets ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=In%20view%20of%20the%20current,some%20unique%20financial%20assistance%20schemes)) ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%98Kapruka%20Ayojana%E2%80%99%20loan%20scheme,products%20in%20the%20world%20market)). By providing affordable credit, the scheme helps industrialists invest in equipment, technology, or working capital for coconut-related manufacturing.

- **Eligibility:** **Entrepreneurs engaged in coconut allied products and industries** are eligible. Businesses must be **officially registered with the Coconut Development Authority**, and the **CDA must recommend the loan application** based on the project’s potential ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). (The CDA ensures the applicant is a bona fide coconut industry player and that the project aligns with national coconut development goals.) Both new and existing coconut-based enterprises can apply, including those involved in traditional products (oil, desiccated coconut, coir, etc.) or innovative coconut derivative products. As with any loan, applicants should have a good credit record and repayment capacity as evaluated by RDB.

- **Loan Amount & Interest:** **Loans up to LKR 2 million per project** are available ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). The scheme offers a highly subsidized interest rate: **6% per annum for investment loans** (e.g. purchasing machinery or building facilities) and **8% per annum for working capital loans** ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=Authority%20are%20eligible%20for%20the,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). These rates are fixed well below market rates. Moreover, to ease the burden, the **CDA provides an interest rebate**: 100% of the interest is reimbursed for the first year, and 50% of the interest from the second through fifth years is reimbursed to the borrower ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=capital%2C%20the%20interest%20rate%20is,repayment%20period%20is%20three%20years)). This effectively reduces the cost of borrowing substantially (in the first year the effective interest to the borrower is 0%, and in years 2–5 it is about 3% after rebate). After year five, the borrower pays the concessionary rate in full if the loan extends beyond that. 

- **Repayment Period:** The repayment terms depend on the loan purpose. **Investment loans** under Jaya Isura can be repaid over **up to 7 years** (to allow time for capital investments to generate returns) ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=Authority%20are%20eligible%20for%20the,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). **Working capital loans** are shorter-term, typically to be repaid within **3 years** ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=Authority%20are%20eligible%20for%20the,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). For both types, the possibility of a grace period or graduated payment structure exists, especially given the interest reimbursements in the early years. RDB usually structures the installment schedule such that the borrower benefits from the interest subsidy period. In summary, investment-oriented projects get a longer tenure, whereas loans for operational needs are shorter, matching the use of funds.

- **How to Apply:** Applications are channeled through the **Regional Development Bank** branches across the country. An interested coconut industry owner should first engage with the Coconut Development Authority to obtain the necessary endorsements. The CDA will confirm the business is registered and the project falls under the scheme’s scope, then provide a recommendation letter for the loan. With this, the entrepreneur can apply at an RDB branch, submitting the business plan and financial statements as required. RDB will evaluate the creditworthiness and viability (often in consultation with CDA on technical aspects) ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). Once approved, the loan is granted by RDB, and the **CDA oversees the interest subsidy payments** as per the scheme. This scheme is available **island-wide** via RDB’s network ([RDB Bank to offer relief for coconut cultivation and industry | Daily FT](https://www.ft.lk/Agriculture/RDB-Bank-to-offer-relief-for-coconut-cultivation-and-industry/31-645166#:~:text=The%20Kapruka%20Jaya%20Isura%20loan,the%20recommendation%20of%20the%20authority)). Prospective applicants can contact the nearest RDB branch or the CDA’s development division for guidance on the application process.

## Smallholder Agribusiness Partnership Programme (SAPP)

- **Provider:** Ministry of Agriculture (Govt of Sri Lanka) with funding support from IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) – implemented via participating banks (such as Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank, etc.) under Central Bank oversight ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,Partnership%20Programme)).

- **Description:** SAPP is a **special credit and grant program to link small farmers with agribusiness value chains**. It operates on a **4P model** (Public-Private-Producer Partnerships), where a private sector buyer (e.g. an agribusiness or exporter) partners with groups of smallholder producers and a financing bank to develop a supply chain ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,SAPP%20and%20tea%20%26%20rubber)). The program provides **concessionary loans, technical assistance, and matching grants** to support projects in various agriculture sectors – including coconut cultivation or processing – that will increase rural incomes. For example, a coconut-based project under SAPP might involve a company sourcing coconuts from small farmers who get funding to expand cultivation or invest in drip irrigation, with a purchase agreement in place. SAPP’s objective is to modernize and commercialize smallholder agriculture (covering crops, livestock, fisheries, etc.) by improving access to finance and markets ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,Partnership%20Programme)) ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=Areas%20for%20which%20credit%20is,provided)).

- **Eligibility:** **Smallholder farmers, farmer organizations, and agri-entrepreneurs** engaging in an approved 4P partnership are eligible. The target groups include:
  - Individual farmers or farmer groups cultivating crops or rearing livestock who have an agreement to supply a partner company ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,SAPP%20and%20tea%20%26%20rubber)).
  - Producer organizations or cooperatives involved in agribusiness partnerships.
  - **Youth entrepreneurs (age 18–40)** starting agribusiness ventures in the agriculture value chain ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,SAPP%20and%20tea%20%26%20rubber)).
  - **Private agribusiness companies (“Promoters”)** that partner with smallholders (these companies can also receive financing to on-lend to farmers or invest in processing, as part of the partnership) ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,SAPP%20and%20tea%20%26%20rubber)).
  
  SAPP covers a wide range of agricultural activities – any commercially viable agribusiness proposal that involves small producers could be considered. For instance, coconut sector projects (e.g. a coconut milk processor working with village coconut growers, or a young entrepreneur making coconut-based snacks sourcing from local farms) would qualify. Participants must be willing to enter into the partnership agreement and meet the creditworthiness criteria of the banks. Typically, the program requires a form of buy-back agreement or off-take contract with the private partner to ensure market linkages for the farmers.

- **Loan Amount & Interest:** **Concessionary interest rates** are offered, generally around **6.5% per annum** on loans under SAPP ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=Interest%20Rate)). The Central Bank provides refinance funds to banks to maintain these low rates (e.g. 3% refinance to banks, enabling final lending rates around 6.5%) ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=Interest%20Rate)). **Loan sizes vary based on the sub-scheme and borrower category**:
  - Small individual farmers can get smaller loans (e.g. up to around LKR 300,000 for minor investments) ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,amount%20decide%20according%20to%20project)).
  - **Youth entrepreneurs** can borrow up to **LKR 2 million** to start agribusiness projects ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,amount%20decide%20according%20to%20project)).
  - Larger producer organizations or **private promoters** facilitating a cluster of farmers can obtain bigger facilities (e.g. up to **LKR 18 million** for a promoter company) ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,amount%20decide%20according%20to%20project)), or even more if justified by the project scale (some loans amounts are determined case-by-case for bigger value-chain projects ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,amount%20decide%20according%20to%20project))).
  - These loans often come with an attached grant component – SAPP might provide a grant (e.g. 20-50% of the project cost) in addition to the loan, depending on the project’s nature and social benefits, though the exact grant percentage varies by scheme component.
  
  The concessional interest and grant support make financing under SAPP very affordable for farmers. This encourages adoption of new technology like irrigation for coconut smallholders or equipment for processing.

- **Repayment Period:** **Up to 5 years repayment** is allowed, with **grace periods of 12 to 18 months** commonly included ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=Maximum%20Amount)). The exact term depends on the project cash flow. For instance, a loan for planting a perennial crop (like coconut or intercropping in a coconut garden) might include an 18-month grace until the first harvest, and then repayment over the next 3.5 years. Loans for equipment or livestock might have slightly shorter grace. Maximum tenure is usually around five years. In all cases, SAPP loans are structured to match the project’s income generation cycle and may offer flexible repayment (such as seasonal installments aligned with harvest). Because the program’s aim is to foster sustainable businesses, it avoids overly short repayment schedules that would strain smallholders.

- **How to Apply:** SAPP is **project-oriented** – applications typically come through calls for proposals or via identified value-chain projects. A smallholder or group interested in SAPP should first be part of a 4P partnership proposal. Often an agribusiness company will initiate a project and sign up farmer suppliers who then apply for SAPP financing. However, individual entrepreneurs can also approach the SAPP coordinating unit (at the Ministry of Agriculture) or participating banks with a project idea. The steps generally are:
  1. **Proposal Development:** Work with SAPP officials or an agribusiness partner to develop a bankable project plan (including the roles of the private partner, farmers, financing needs, etc.).
  2. **Bank Application:** Submit the proposal to a participating bank (such as People’s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, or others involved in SAPP). The bank will evaluate the loan part of the project.
  3. **Approval:** The project is reviewed by a SAPP committee and the bank. Once approved, the loan is disbursed by the bank, and any grant portion is provided through the SAPP program.
  
  Farmers’ organizations and companies can get information and help from the **SAPP Program Management Unit** under the Ministry or from the local agriculture extension offices. Because this is a national program, it operates in many districts – **all districts are covered** if viable projects are present. The key is to have an organized partnership; thus, direct walk-in applications may be guided to form or join a 4P arrangement. In summary, to access SAPP financing for a coconut-related venture, one should engage with the program facilitators (or an implementing partner like a processing company) and then apply through a partner bank with the project documentation ([Best Business Development Loans in Sri Lanka | Low-Interest - People's Bank](https://www.peoplesbank.lk/development-loans/#:~:text=,SAPP%20and%20tea%20%26%20rubber)).
