- **"Sense-IT: An Aquaculture-Specific Autonomous Data Acquisition and Monitoring System"** - *IEEE (2022)*.
  *Abstract:* Aquaculture is now on an equal level with conventional fisheries in terms of economic impact. And by 2030, aquaculture will account for 60% of world fish consumption, while fishing will account for 40%. Aiming to enhance the process, a design of IoT-based real time data logger system for monitoring and visualizing water health by measuring associated water parameters of any aquaculture is presented in this work. The data logger, named Sense-IT is designed as a microcontroller-driven configuration where the program is developed in the C programming language. Water pH, Total dissolved solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Water Salinity, Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), Dissolved ammonia, Florien, chlorine, and other parameters can be measured with this device. The microcontroller uses the RS-485 RTU communication protocol to connect with the sensors. This device collects all sensor data and sends it to the system's cloud server. This device is controlled and configured via a PHP Laravel-based web application that also allows the user to visualize the current status of the target water body. This device is adaptable since it can connect through Wi-Fi or GSM depending on the user's preference or network availability. The sensors provide robust accurate data and constantly monitors different environmental conditions of the target waterbody and records with a timestamp.
