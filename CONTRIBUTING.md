# Contributing to the Coconut Plantation Smart AgriTech Research Project

First and foremost, thank you for showing interest in contributing. This project is part of a community-driven research effort aiming to improve the yield of coconut plantations in Sri Lanka through AgriTech and IT collaboration.

Our goal is to create a **fully open-source, multilingual, and field-validated model** that benefits farmers, students, researchers, and policymakers alike. We believe that breaking down institutional silos and working together can help build a sustainable and inclusive future for agriculture.
